## Features
- üìù Documentation as Code (via Github)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Collaborative editing (via Etherpad)
- üìΩ React-based Slideshow
- ‚úçÔ∏è Write using Markdown, React components, even HTML!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/AirWalk-Digital/airview-next`
2. in VScode - "Open in Container" using remote containers.
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
5. Run storybook: `npm run storybook`

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing JSX

You can use JSX in [a few ways](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started) in your MDX files:

- You can use the syntax with HTML (`<button style={{ color: "red" }}>`)
- You can import React component from other files (`import Button from "../components/Button"`). Then you can use that component anywhere in that MDX file. The path to the component is relative to the MDX file.
- You can use any React component imported into the `<MDXProvider>` (inside `/components/MDXProvider.js`). This allows you to use the component without importing it inside each MDX file.
- You can define React components inside MDX files and then use them. MDX supports the use of JS inside files, like exporting variables, or in this case ‚Äî defining new functions. `const Button = () => <button style={{ color: "red" }}>`

[Check out the MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started) for more information on the syntax.


### Adding/replacing components in MDX

MDX allows you to use JSX inline or import components, but if you want to use a React component across all slides without importing it, you can use the `<MDXProvider>` component. This component wraps the app in a "context" that provides MDX with components to pass into the parser.

This also lets you replace Markdown parsed HTML elements with React components, like replacing `## Headings` with `<Heading as="h2">` instead of the default `<h2>`. This comes in handy if you have a React component library and you want to use it's primitives like `<Text>` for paragraphs.

You can pass new components, or swap HTML elements inside the `mdComponents` object in the `/components/MDXProvider.jsx` file:

```jsx
const mdComponents = {
  h1: (props) => <h1 {...props} />,
  CustomButton,
};
```
